# pyarts-fluxes

Python module for calculating radiative fluxes with ARTS.
The module is an easy-to-use wrapper to calculate radiative fluxes with ARTS.
The idea behind is to prepare a basic setup so that the user can easily calculate radiative fluxes with ARTS without having to deal with the actual ARTS simulation setup.
Expierenceed users can still access the ARTS workspace and modify it as they like.
